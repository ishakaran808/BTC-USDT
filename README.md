**1. Introduction
**For years, algorithmic trading has grown in financial markets, including cryptocurrency. Crypto market volatility and 24/7 nature offer lucrative opportunities for algorithmic trading strategies. Unlike traditional assets, modelling and optimising cryptocurrency algorithmic trading systems is difficult. This report details our approach to developing algorithmic trading models tailored to the Bitcoin (BTC)/Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency market. The problem statement for this competition was to create profitable algorithmic trading models for the BTC/USDT market that can consistently outperform benchmark returns, manage risk, and capitalise on the dynamics of this volatile market. Combining cryptocurrency expertise with statistical modelling, machine learning, and programming skills is crucial. The increased volatility requires effective risk management in the models. This undertaking highlighted the complexity of accurately modeling and trading Bitcoin compared to traditional assets. Our team relished this challenge to unlock alpha opportunities in the growing cryptocurrency space with data-driven and rigorously backtested algorithmic trading systems. The following sections detail our methodology, results, and insights.
